    "\n",
    "As we've seen with previous topics, sklearn has a lot of built in functionality that can save us from writing the code from scratch. We are going to solve the same problem in the previous activity, but using sklearn!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `SpamDectector` class in the previous activity is an example of a **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) model**. An MNB lets us know that each conditional probability we're looking at (i.e. $P(spam | w_1, w_2, ..., w_n)$) is a multinomial (several terms, polynomial) distribution, rather than another type distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In groups of 3, complete the activity by using the provided starter code and following the steps below:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - Split the dataset\n",

    "`from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Vectorize the dataset : `vect = CountVectorizer()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - Transform training data into a document-term matrix (BoW): `X_train_dtm = vect.fit_transform(X_train)`\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - Build and evaluate the model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember how you prepared/cleaned/labeled the dataset, created texts and tags, and split the data innto train vs test from the previous activity. You'll need to do so again here\n",
    "- Review the [CountVectorizer documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) to see how you can transform text into numerical vectors\n",
