    "## Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees are considered one of the most mature, traditional, algorithms in predictive analytics\n",
    "- They are typically used to solve classification problems through visual and explicit representations of decisions and decision making.\n",
    "- Think of them like a map where you follow each path according to your decision, and each path leads to a new choice to make until you reach the end.\n",
    "- They mimic the way you probably make decisions in your daily life:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root:** Our starting point for the tree. Note that a decision tree is drawn upside down since its root is at the top\n",
    "    - `Alone Or With Friends` is the root in the above example\n",
    "- **Branch:** Also known as an _edge_, these lead from condition to condition, down to the results\n",
    "    - `Sunny` or `Rainy` are branches in the above example\n",
    "- **Condition:** Also known as an _internal node_, this is the choice that needs to be made in order to figure out which branch to take.\n",
    "    - `Weather Outside?` is our condiition in the above example\n",
    "- **Leaf:** Also known as a _decision_, these are the final results that signify the classification of the data. There are no branches coming out of a leaf, only going in to it.\n",
    "    - `video games`, `soccer` and `movies` are all examples of a leaf"
